### **AWS S3 Hands-On Exercise**

This exercise will guide you through setting up, configuring, and interacting with Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). You will create buckets, upload/download objects, configure bucket policies, and enable versioning.

---

### **Objective**
1. Understand how to create and manage S3 buckets.
2. Perform basic S3 operations like uploading, downloading, and deleting objects.
3. Explore advanced features like bucket policies, versioning, and static website hosting.



### **Prerequisites**
1. An active AWS account.
2. AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials.
3. Basic understanding of AWS Management Console and CLI.



### **Exercise Steps**

#### **Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket**
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the **S3 Dashboard**.
3. Click **Create Bucket** and configure:
   - **Bucket Name**: `my-demo-bucket-<your-name>` (must be globally unique).
   - **Region**: Choose a region close to your location.
   - Leave the default settings (block public access enabled).
   - Click **Create Bucket**.


#### **Step 2: Upload an Object to the Bucket**
1. Open the bucket you just created.
2. Click **Upload** > **Add Files** and select a file from your computer (e.g., a text or image file).
3. Click **Upload**.


#### **Step 3: Access the Object**
1. Click the uploaded file to open its details.
2. Copy the **Object URL**.
3. Paste the URL into your browser. You will see an **Access Denied** error (due to blocked public access).
4. **Optional**: Update the permissions to make the object public (not recommended for production).


#### **Step 4: Enable Versioning**
1. Navigate to the **Properties** tab of your bucket.
2. Enable **Bucket Versioning**.
3. Upload the same file again with slight modifications (e.g., change the content or name).
4. Check the **Versions** tab to view multiple versions of the file.


#### **Step 5: Use AWS CLI for S3 Operations**
1. **List all buckets**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls
   ```
2. **Upload a file**:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, S3!" > hello.txt
   aws s3 cp hello.txt s3://my-demo-bucket-<your-name>/
   ```
3. **Download the file**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp s3://my-demo-bucket-<your-name>/hello.txt .
   ```
4. **Delete the file**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 rm s3://my-demo-bucket-<your-name>/hello.txt
   ```


#### **Step 6: Configure a Bucket Policy**
1. Open your bucket in the S3 console.
2. Navigate to the **Permissions** tab > **Bucket Policy**.
3. Add a policy to allow public read access to the bucket:
   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": "s3:GetObject",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-demo-bucket-<your-name>/*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
4. Save the policy and test public access to an object by copying its URL into a browser.


#### **Step 7: Enable Static Website Hosting**
1. Navigate to the **Properties** tab of your bucket.
2. Enable **Static Website Hosting**:
   - Index Document: `index.html`
   - Error Document: `error.html`
3. Upload a sample `index.html` file:
   ```html
   <html>
     <body>
       <h1>Welcome to My S3 Static Website!</h1>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```
4. Copy the **Endpoint URL** and test it in a browser.


#### **Step 8: Clean Up**
1. Delete the objects in your bucket.
2. Turn off versioning if enabled.
3. Delete the bucket.

### **AWS S3 Access Point Demonstration**

This demonstration focuses on creating and using **S3 Access Points** to simplify managing data access for shared datasets. S3 Access Points allow you to create dedicated access configurations for specific applications or users, each with its own unique permissions and network settings.


### **Objective**
1. Create an S3 bucket and upload sample data.
2. Create an S3 Access Point for the bucket.
3. Use the Access Point to perform operations on S3 objects.
4. Test access restrictions via Access Point policies.


### **Prerequisites**
1. An active AWS account.
2. AWS CLI installed and configured with credentials.
3. Basic understanding of S3 bucket policies and IAM roles.


### **Steps for the Demo**


#### **Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket**
1. Navigate to the **S3 Console**.
2. Click **Create Bucket**:
   - **Bucket Name**: `my-access-point-demo-<your-name>` (must be globally unique).
   - **Region**: Choose your preferred AWS region.
   - Leave **Block Public Access** enabled.
   - Click **Create Bucket**.


#### **Step 2: Upload Sample Data**
1. Open the bucket and click **Upload**.
2. Upload a sample file (e.g., `sample.txt`).
3. Confirm the file is uploaded by listing the objects in the bucket.


#### **Step 3: Create an S3 Access Point**
1. Navigate to the **Access Points** tab in the S3 Console.
2. Click **Create Access Point** and configure:
   - **Name**: `demo-access-point`.
   - **Bucket**: Select your created bucket (`my-access-point-demo-<your-name>`).
   - **VPC Settings**:
     - Choose "None" to allow access over the internet.
     - Or, choose a specific VPC to restrict access to that VPC.
   - Leave all other settings default.
   - Click **Create Access Point**.


#### **Step 4: Use the Access Point**
1. Copy the ARN of the Access Point from the details page (it looks like `arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/demo-access-point`).

2. Perform S3 operations using the Access Point:
   - **List bucket contents**:
     ```bash
     aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/demo-access-point
     ```
   - **Upload a file**:
     ```bash
     echo "Access Point Demo" > access_point_demo.txt
     aws s3api put-object --bucket arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/demo-access-point --key access_point_demo.txt --body access_point_demo.txt
     ```
   - **Download a file**:
     ```bash
     aws s3api get-object --bucket arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/demo-access-point --key sample.txt downloaded_sample.txt
     ```


#### **Step 5: Configure Access Point Policies**
1. Open the Access Point in the S3 Console.
2. Add a policy to restrict access to only a specific IAM role or principal:
   - Example: Allow access only to a specific IAM role:
     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Principal": {
                     "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/demo-role"
                 },
                 "Action": "s3:*",
                 "Resource": [
                     "arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/demo-access-point/*",
                     "arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/demo-access-point"
                 ]
             }
         ]
     }
     ```
3. Save the policy.

4. Test access:
   - Log in as the specified IAM role or principal.
   - Attempt to perform an operation (e.g., upload a file).
   - Any unauthorized user or role should be denied access.


#### **Step 6: Clean Up**
1. Delete all objects in the bucket.
2. Delete the Access Point.
3. Delete the S3 bucket.

### **S3 Bucket Creation and Demonstration of Different Permissions**

This demonstration will show how to create an S3 bucket and apply different types of permissions to control access for various use cases. We'll explore bucket-level permissions, object-level permissions, and user-based access.

### **Objective**
1. Create an S3 bucket.
2. Set up different permissions for:
   - Read-only access.
   - Write-only access.
   - Full access (read/write).
   - Object-level permissions.
3. Test access for different IAM users or roles.

### **Prerequisites**
1. An active AWS account.
2. At least two IAM users or roles with distinct access policies (e.g., `ReadOnlyUser` and `WriteOnlyUser`).
3. AWS CLI installed and configured.


### **Steps for the Demo**

#### **Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket**
1. Log in to the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Navigate to the **S3 Dashboard**.
3. Click **Create Bucket** and configure:
   - **Bucket Name**: `permissions-demo-bucket-<your-name>` (must be unique).
   - **Region**: Select a region close to your location.
   - Leave **Block Public Access** enabled.
   - Click **Create Bucket**.


#### **Step 2: Upload Sample Objects**
1. Open the bucket and upload the following files:
   - `readme.txt`: For testing read access.
   - `upload-test.txt`: Placeholder file for testing write access.


#### **Step 3: Set Permissions for Read-Only Access**
1. Attach a policy to the `ReadOnlyUser` or an IAM group:
   - **IAM Policy** for read-only access:
     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                 "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::permissions-demo-bucket-<your-name>/*"
             }
         ]
     }
     ```
2. Test with `ReadOnlyUser`:
   - **Success**: User can download `readme.txt` using AWS CLI:
     ```bash
     aws s3 cp s3://permissions-demo-bucket-<your-name>/readme.txt .
     ```
   - **Failure**: User cannot upload a file:
     ```bash
     aws s3 cp localfile.txt s3://permissions-demo-bucket-<your-name>/
     # Access Denied
     ```


#### **Step 4: Set Permissions for Write-Only Access**
1. Attach a policy to the `WriteOnlyUser` or an IAM group:
   - **IAM Policy** for write-only access:
     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": "s3:PutObject",
                 "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::permissions-demo-bucket-<your-name>/*"
             }
         ]
     }
     ```
2. Test with `WriteOnlyUser`:
   - **Success**: User can upload a file:
     ```bash
     echo "Write-only test" > write-test.txt
     aws s3 cp write-test.txt s3://permissions-demo-bucket-<your-name>/
     ```
   - **Failure**: User cannot download `readme.txt`:
     ```bash
     aws s3 cp s3://permissions-demo-bucket-<your-name>/readme.txt .
     # Access Denied
     ```

#### **Step 5: Set Permissions for Full Access**
1. Attach a policy to the `FullAccessUser` or an IAM group:
   - **IAM Policy** for full access:
     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": "s3:*",
                 "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::permissions-demo-bucket-<your-name>/*"
             }
         ]
     }
     ```
2. Test with `FullAccessUser`:
   - User can upload, download, and delete objects:
     ```bash
     # Upload
     aws s3 cp fullaccess.txt s3://permissions-demo-bucket-<your-name>/

     # Download
     aws s3 cp s3://permissions-demo-bucket-<your-name>/readme.txt .

     # Delete
     aws s3 rm s3://permissions-demo-bucket-<your-name>/readme.txt
     ```

#### **Step 6: Demonstrate Object-Level Permissions**
1. Open the bucket in the S3 Console.
2. Select `readme.txt` and go to **Permissions** > **ACLs**.
3. Grant read access to another AWS account (or specific IAM user).
   - Enter the **AWS account ID**.
   - Grant **Read Access**.
4. Test access from the granted account:
   - The user can only download `readme.txt` but cannot access other files.


#### **Step 7: Clean Up**
1. Delete all objects in the bucket.
2. Delete the S3 bucket.
3. Remove IAM users, roles, or policies created for this demo.
