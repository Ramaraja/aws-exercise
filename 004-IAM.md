**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Hands-On Exercises** to help you understand how to create and manage IAM resources and policies.

---

### **Exercise 1: Create an IAM User with Limited Permissions**
1. **Objective**: Create an IAM user and assign specific permissions for S3 access.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Navigate to IAM**:
   - Open the **IAM Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
2. **Create a New User**:
   - Click **Users** > **Add Users**.
   - **User Name**: `S3User`
   - **Access Type**: Select `Programmatic access`.
3. **Attach Policy**:
   - Choose **Attach existing policies directly**.
   - Select the policy: `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`.
4. **Review and Create**:
   - Click **Next** and then **Create User**.
5. **Save Credentials**:
   - Download the credentials (`.csv` file) for this user.
6. **Test**:
   - Use the AWS CLI to confirm the user can list S3 buckets but cannot create or delete them:
     ```bash
     aws configure
     aws s3 ls
     ```

---

### **Exercise 2: Create a Custom IAM Policy**
1. **Objective**: Create a custom policy that allows an IAM user to access a specific S3 bucket only.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Navigate to Policies**:
   - In the IAM dashboard, go to **Policies** > **Create Policy**.
2. **Write the Policy**:
   - Choose the JSON editor and input:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "s3:*",
           "Resource": [
             "arn:aws:s3:::my-unique-bucket",
             "arn:aws:s3:::my-unique-bucket/*"
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
3. **Review and Create**:
   - Name the policy `S3BucketFullAccess` and save it.
4. **Attach Policy to a User**:
   - Attach the policy to the `S3User` created in Exercise 1.
5. **Test**:
   - Ensure the user can access only the specified bucket.

---

### **Exercise 3: Create an IAM Role for EC2**
1. **Objective**: Create a role that allows an EC2 instance to access an S3 bucket.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Create a Role**:
   - Go to **Roles** > **Create Role**.
   - Select **AWS Service** > **EC2**.
   - Attach the policy `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`.
   - Name the role `EC2S3ReadOnlyRole`.
2. **Launch an EC2 Instance with the Role**:
   - Start a new EC2 instance.
   - Under **Advanced Details**, choose the IAM role `EC2S3ReadOnlyRole`.
3. **Test the Role**:
   - SSH into the EC2 instance and test S3 access:
     ```bash
     aws s3 ls
     ```
   - Verify the instance can list buckets without requiring credentials.

---

### **Exercise 4: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for an IAM User**
1. **Objective**: Enhance security by requiring MFA for console access.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Assign MFA to a User**:
   - In the IAM dashboard, select the user (e.g., `S3User`).
   - Go to **Security Credentials** > **Manage MFA**.
   - Choose **Virtual MFA Device** and use an app like Google Authenticator to scan the QR code.
   - Complete setup by entering two consecutive OTP codes.
2. **Test MFA**:
   - Log out and try to log in as the user. You should be prompted for an MFA code.

---

### **Exercise 5: Set Up a Password Policy**
1. **Objective**: Create a strong password policy for all IAM users in your account.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Navigate to Account Settings**:
   - Go to **IAM Dashboard** > **Account Settings**.
2. **Set Password Policy**:
   - Configure the following options:
     - Minimum password length: 12.
     - Require at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character.
     - Allow password expiration and enforce password changes every 90 days.
   - Save changes.

---

### **Exercise 6: Use IAM Policies for Resource Tag-Based Access**
1. **Objective**: Allow users to manage only resources with specific tags.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Create a Policy**:
   - Go to **Policies** > **Create Policy**.
   - Use the JSON editor:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "ec2:*",
           "Resource": "*",
           "Condition": {
             "StringEquals": {
               "aws:RequestTag/Environment": "Development"
             }
           }
         },
         {
           "Effect": "Deny",
           "Action": "ec2:*",
           "Resource": "*",
           "Condition": {
             "StringNotEquals": {
               "aws:RequestTag/Environment": "Development"
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
2. **Attach Policy**:
   - Attach this policy to a new IAM user.
3. **Test**:
   - Try to create an EC2 instance with and without the `Environment=Development` tag.

### **Exercise 7: Use IAM Role
**IAM Role Demonstration** that you can use during a training session. It focuses on creating and using an IAM role to enable an EC2 instance to access an S3 bucket without using hardcoded credentials.

---

### **Objective**
Demonstrate how to:
1. Create an IAM role.
2. Attach the role to an EC2 instance.
3. Access an S3 bucket from the EC2 instance using the role.

---

### **Prerequisites**
1. An active AWS account.
2. An existing S3 bucket (e.g., `my-demo-bucket`).
3. Basic familiarity with AWS services (IAM, EC2, S3).
4. AWS CLI installed on your local system (if you plan to demonstrate from SSH).

---

### **Steps for the Demo**

#### **Step 1: Create an IAM Role**
1. **Navigate to IAM Roles**:
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to **IAM Dashboard** > **Roles**.

2. **Create a New Role**:
   - Click **Create role**.
   - Choose **AWS Service** and select **EC2** as the trusted entity.
   - Click **Next**.

3. **Attach a Policy**:
   - Choose the existing policy `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`.
   - This policy allows the role to read objects from any S3 bucket.

4. **Configure Role Name**:
   - Name the role `EC2S3ReadOnlyRole`.
   - Add an optional description: "This role allows EC2 to access S3 with read-only permissions."
   - Click **Create role**.

---

#### **Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance**
1. **Navigate to EC2**:
   - Open the EC2 Dashboard.

2. **Launch a New Instance**:
   - Click **Launch Instances**.
   - Select an Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu AMI.
   - Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier).
   - Proceed to **Configure Instance**.

3. **Attach the IAM Role**:
   - Under **Advanced Details**, find the **IAM Role** dropdown.
   - Select the role you created (`EC2S3ReadOnlyRole`).

4. **Complete the Launch**:
   - Add storage and configure security groups as needed.
   - Launch the instance and download the key pair for SSH access.

---

#### **Step 3: Verify IAM Role Access**
1. **Connect to the EC2 Instance**:
   - SSH into the instance:
     ```bash
     ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP>
     ```

2. **Install AWS CLI** (if not already installed):
   - For Amazon Linux 2:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install aws-cli -y
     ```
   - For Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install awscli -y
     ```

3. **Test S3 Access**:
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     aws s3 ls
     ```
   - You should see a list of S3 buckets, including `my-demo-bucket`.

4. **Try Accessing a Specific Bucket**:
   - List the contents of the bucket:
     ```bash
     aws s3 ls s3://my-demo-bucket
     ```

---

### **Explanation During the Demo**
- Highlight that no credentials (e.g., access keys) were configured.
- Explain that the EC2 instance automatically assumes the role, retrieving temporary credentials via the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS).
- Show the roleâ€™s permissions by navigating to the IAM role in the console.

---

### **Step 4: Clean Up**
1. **Terminate the EC2 Instance**:
   - Go to the EC2 Dashboard and stop/terminate the instance.

2. **Remove the Role**:
   - Navigate to IAM > Roles.
   - Delete the `EC2S3ReadOnlyRole`.

---

### **Talking Points**
1. **Why Roles?**
   - No need for hardcoded credentials in applications or instances.
   - Temporary credentials enhance security.
   - Roles are managed centrally and can be easily updated.

2. **Security Advantages**:
   - IAM roles help adhere to the **principle of least privilege**.
   - They minimize the attack surface by avoiding long-term credentials.

3. **Real-World Applications**:
   - Assign roles to Lambda functions to access DynamoDB.
   - Enable cross-account resource access using roles.
