### **Elastic Beanstalk Example: Deploying a Simple Application**

This example will:
1. Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment.
2. Deploy a simple web application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

---

### **Prerequisites**

1. Install the **AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI (EB CLI)** or use the AWS Management Console.
2. Ensure you have a working AWS account and the necessary IAM permissions to manage Elastic Beanstalk.
3. Set up an S3 bucket where the application bundle will be uploaded if you're using the CLI.

---

### **Steps to Create and Deploy an Application**

#### **1. Create a Simple Web Application**

**Example: Python Flask Application**

Save the following code as `application.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello, Elastic Beanstalk!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

Create a `requirements.txt` file to list dependencies:

```
Flask==2.1.3
```

#### **2. Initialize Elastic Beanstalk**

1. **Install EB CLI (if not already installed)**:
   - On macOS: `brew install awsebcli`
   - On Linux/Ubuntu: `sudo pip install awsebcli`
   - On Windows: Use the AWS CLI installer.

2. **Initialize a Beanstalk Application**:
   Run the following command in the application directory:
   ```bash
   eb init
   ```
   - Choose a region.
   - Select the platform (e.g., Python).
   - Provide a name for the application.
   - Configure SSH for EC2 instances (optional).

#### **3. Create an Environment**

1. Use the following command to create a Beanstalk environment:
   ```bash
   eb create my-env
   ```
   - Replace `my-env` with your desired environment name.
   - Elastic Beanstalk will automatically provision resources (EC2 instances, load balancer, etc.).

2. Check the status of the environment:
   ```bash
   eb status
   ```

#### **4. Deploy the Application**

1. Deploy the application to the Beanstalk environment:
   ```bash
   eb deploy
   ```

2. Access the application:
   - Get the URL of the environment using:
     ```bash
     eb open
     ```
   - The URL should display "Hello, Elastic Beanstalk!"


### **Example CloudFormation Template for Elastic Beanstalk**

If you prefer to use CloudFormation to set up Elastic Beanstalk:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: Deploy a simple application using Elastic Beanstalk.

Resources:
  ElasticBeanstalkApplication:
    Type: "AWS::ElasticBeanstalk::Application"
    Properties:
      ApplicationName: "MyBeanstalkApp"
      Description: "Sample Elastic Beanstalk Application"

  ElasticBeanstalkEnvironment:
    Type: "AWS::ElasticBeanstalk::Environment"
    Properties:
      EnvironmentName: "MyEnvironment"
      ApplicationName: !Ref ElasticBeanstalkApplication
      SolutionStackName: "64bit Amazon Linux 2 v3.4.5 running Python 3.8"
      OptionSettings:
        - Namespace: "aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment"
          OptionName: "EnvironmentType"
          Value: "LoadBalanced"
      VersionLabel: "InitialVersion"

  ApplicationVersion:
    Type: "AWS::ElasticBeanstalk::ApplicationVersion"
    Properties:
      ApplicationName: !Ref ElasticBeanstalkApplication
      Description: "Initial application version"
      SourceBundle:
        S3Bucket: "my-s3-bucket"
        S3Key: "my-app.zip"
```

Replace `my-s3-bucket` and `my-app.zip` with your S3 bucket name and application file.
