### **AWS S3 Hands-On Exercise**

This exercise will guide you through setting up, configuring, and interacting with Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). You will create buckets, upload/download objects, configure bucket policies, and enable versioning.

---

### **Objective**
1. Understand how to create and manage S3 buckets.
2. Perform basic S3 operations like uploading, downloading, and deleting objects.
3. Explore advanced features like bucket policies, versioning, and static website hosting.

---

### **Prerequisites**
1. An active AWS account.
2. AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials.
3. Basic understanding of AWS Management Console and CLI.

---

### **Exercise Steps**

---

#### **Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket**
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the **S3 Dashboard**.
3. Click **Create Bucket** and configure:
   - **Bucket Name**: `my-demo-bucket-<your-name>` (must be globally unique).
   - **Region**: Choose a region close to your location.
   - Leave the default settings (block public access enabled).
   - Click **Create Bucket**.

---

#### **Step 2: Upload an Object to the Bucket**
1. Open the bucket you just created.
2. Click **Upload** > **Add Files** and select a file from your computer (e.g., a text or image file).
3. Click **Upload**.

---

#### **Step 3: Access the Object**
1. Click the uploaded file to open its details.
2. Copy the **Object URL**.
3. Paste the URL into your browser. You will see an **Access Denied** error (due to blocked public access).
4. **Optional**: Update the permissions to make the object public (not recommended for production).

---

#### **Step 4: Enable Versioning**
1. Navigate to the **Properties** tab of your bucket.
2. Enable **Bucket Versioning**.
3. Upload the same file again with slight modifications (e.g., change the content or name).
4. Check the **Versions** tab to view multiple versions of the file.

---

#### **Step 5: Use AWS CLI for S3 Operations**
1. **List all buckets**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls
   ```
2. **Upload a file**:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, S3!" > hello.txt
   aws s3 cp hello.txt s3://my-demo-bucket-<your-name>/
   ```
3. **Download the file**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp s3://my-demo-bucket-<your-name>/hello.txt .
   ```
4. **Delete the file**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 rm s3://my-demo-bucket-<your-name>/hello.txt
   ```

---

#### **Step 6: Configure a Bucket Policy**
1. Open your bucket in the S3 console.
2. Navigate to the **Permissions** tab > **Bucket Policy**.
3. Add a policy to allow public read access to the bucket:
   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": "s3:GetObject",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-demo-bucket-<your-name>/*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
4. Save the policy and test public access to an object by copying its URL into a browser.

---

#### **Step 7: Enable Static Website Hosting**
1. Navigate to the **Properties** tab of your bucket.
2. Enable **Static Website Hosting**:
   - Index Document: `index.html`
   - Error Document: `error.html`
3. Upload a sample `index.html` file:
   ```html
   <html>
     <body>
       <h1>Welcome to My S3 Static Website!</h1>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```
4. Copy the **Endpoint URL** and test it in a browser.

---

#### **Step 8: Clean Up**
1. Delete the objects in your bucket.
2. Turn off versioning if enabled.
3. Delete the bucket.
