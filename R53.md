Manage **Amazon Route 53** using the **AWS Management Console UI**.

### **Step 1: Accessing Route 53**

1. **Log in to AWS Console**:
   - Open the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
   - Enter your credentials (username and password).

2. **Navigate to Route 53**:
   - In the **AWS Management Console**, in the search bar, type "Route 53" and click on the Route 53 service.



### **Step 2: Create a Hosted Zone**

A hosted zone is a container for DNS records, and it's required to manage the DNS for a domain.

1. **Click on Hosted Zones**:
   - In the left-hand navigation panel, click on **Hosted zones**.

2. **Create a Hosted Zone**:
   - Click the **Create hosted zone** button at the top.

3. **Fill in the Hosted Zone Details**:
   - **Domain Name**: Enter your domain name, for example, `example.com`.
   - **Type**: Choose **Public hosted zone** (since you want it to be accessible from the internet).
   - **Comment**: Optional, you can leave this blank or add a comment.
   - **VPC**: Leave it unassociated unless you want to associate it with a private VPC.
   - **Click Create**.

   Once created, you will see the hosted zone in your list, and it will have two default records:
   - **NS (Name Server)** record.
   - **SOA (Start of Authority)** record.



### **Step 3: Add a DNS Record**

Now that you have a hosted zone, you can add DNS records (such as A, CNAME, MX, etc.).

1. **Click on the Hosted Zone**:
   - In the **Hosted Zones** section, click on your hosted zone (e.g., `example.com`).

2. **Click Create Record**:
   - At the top of the hosted zone, click **Create record**.

3. **Choose Record Type**:
   - For this example, let’s create an **A record** (address record), which maps a domain to an IP address.
   - In the **Record type** dropdown, select **A – IPv4 address**.

4. **Fill in the Record Details**:
   - **Record name**: Enter the subdomain or leave blank to point to the root domain. For example, for `www.example.com`, type `www`.
   - **Value**: Enter the IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
   - **TTL (Time to Live)**: Set the TTL (in seconds). A default of 300 seconds is often used.
   - **Routing policy**: Choose **Simple routing** (default). This works for basic setups.
   - **Evaluate target health**: Leave this option disabled unless you are setting up health checks.
   - **Click Create records**.

   You have now created an A record for `www.example.com` pointing to the IP `192.168.1.1`.



### **Step 4: View and Edit DNS Records**

1. **View Records**:
   - In the hosted zone view, you’ll see the new **A record** you created.
   - If you added a subdomain, it will be listed as `www.example.com`.

2. **Edit a Record**:
   - To modify a record, click on the **edit** icon (pencil) next to the record.
   - Update the **Value**, **TTL**, or other settings.
   - After making changes, click **Save changes**.



### **Step 5: Add More DNS Records (Optional)**

You can create various types of records, such as:

- **CNAME Record** (for aliasing another domain):
  - Choose **CNAME – Canonical name** as the record type.
  - Example: `www` → `example.com` (if you want `www.example.com` to point to `example.com`).

- **MX Record** (for mail server routing):
  - Choose **MX – Mail exchange** as the record type.
  - Set the **Value** to the mail server address and priority.

- **TXT Record** (for SPF or domain verification):
  - Choose **TXT** as the record type and add a text value (e.g., `v=spf1 include:spf.example.com ~all`).



### **Step 6: Test the DNS Resolution**

Once the records have propagated (this can take some time), you can test them:

1. **Using the Command Line**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to check the DNS resolution:
     ```bash
     nslookup www.example.com
     ```
   - This should return the IP address you configured.

2. **Using Online Tools**:
   - Use online tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org/) to verify the propagation of your DNS records globally.



### **Step 7: Delete a DNS Record (Optional)**

If you need to delete a DNS record:

1. **Go to Hosted Zone**:
   - Click on your hosted zone in the AWS Route 53 console.

2. **Delete a Record**:
   - Click the **Delete** button next to the record you want to remove (e.g., `www.example.com`).
   - Confirm the deletion.


### **Step 8: Monitor DNS Health (Optional)**

Route 53 also offers health checks for your records. This is useful for ensuring that your website or server is up and running.

1. **Create Health Check**:
   - In the Route 53 console, click on **Health Checks** in the left sidebar.
   - Click **Create health check**.
   - Configure the health check (e.g., monitor if a web server is reachable on `http://www.example.com`).
   - Link this health check to the relevant DNS record for automatic failover.
